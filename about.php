       ImageJ was developed by the National Institutes of Health for the 
       worldwide community. Since it was developed to be open source, the 
       source code will always be freely available, furthering the usefulness 
       of the program to the varieties of developers. It was originally 
       developed for Macintosh but now supports distributions for Windows, 
       Mac OS, Mac OS X and Linux, as long as the machine has Java 1.4 or later.
       The program is designed to be a useful tool in the image-processing 
       process. “It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print” images 
       you need. It reads six plus different image formats and supports stacks
       as well.

       This is just scratching the surface of what ImageJ is capable of. ImageJ 
       is meant for all different fields of science, and is built to be added 
       onto and expanded for greater use. For more information on ImageJ and
